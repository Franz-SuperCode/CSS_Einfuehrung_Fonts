        <h1>Oh Leela! You're the only person I could turn to</h1>
        <p>Yeah. Give a little credit to our public schools. Oh, you're a dollar naughtier than most. I don't 'need' to
            drink. I can quit anytime I want! Whoa a real live robot; or is that some kind of cheesy New Year's costume?
        </p>
        <p>You won't have time for sleeping, soldier, not with all the bed making you'll be doing. Switzerland is small
            and neutral! <strong> We are more like Germany, ambitious and misunderstood!</strong> <em> Enough about your
                promiscuous mother, Hermes!</em> We have bigger problems.</p>
        <h2>It must be wonderful.</h2>
        <p>I suppose I could part with 'one' and still be feared… We can't compete with Mom! Her company is big and
            evil! Ours is small and neutral! I just told you! You've killed me! Kids have names? Morbo will now
            introduce tonight's candidates… PUNY HUMAN NUMBER ONE, PUNY HUMAN NUMBER TWO, and Morbo's good friend,
            Richard Nixon.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You mean while I'm sleeping in it?</li>
            <li>Uh, is the puppy mechanical in any way?</li>
            <li>Quite possible. We live long and are celebrated poopers.</li>
